# Video Manipulation Detection Using AI

This project uses an AI-powered video analysis pipeline to detect potential video manipulations such as deepfakes and other visual tampering. It leverages the **DEtection TRansformer (DETR)** model for object detection and optical flow analysis to identify motion inconsistencies. The application is built using **Streamlit**, and the model processes videos to generate detailed reports on their authenticity.

## Features
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts and displays metadata from uploaded videos.
- **Frame Extraction**: Extracts frames from videos at specified intervals for analysis.
- **Object Detection**: Analyzes each frame to detect objects using the DETR model.
- **Optical Flow Calculation**: Computes motion patterns to detect inconsistencies.
- **Report Generation**: Compiles visual and motion analysis results into a comprehensive JSON report.
- **Manipulation Detection**: Uses the report to assess the likelihood of video manipulation.

## Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: Front-end web framework for creating the user interface.
- **PyTorch**: Machine learning framework used for object detection (DETR).
- **OpenCV**: Library for video and image processing (frame extraction, optical flow).
- **Transformers**: Pre-trained DETR model for object detection.
- **FFmpeg**: Tool for extracting metadata from videos and processing video files.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-manipulation-detection.git
   cd video-manipulation-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. **Upload a Video**: Go to the "Analyze Video" section and upload a `.mp4` or `.mov` video file.
2. **Start Analysis**: Click the **"Analyze Video"** button to start processing.
3. **View Results**: After analysis, the app will display a score and details about the potential manipulation of the video.

## Report Details
The report includes the following information:
- **Frame Analysis**: Number of detections, maximum and average confidence of the object detection model.
- **Motion Analysis**: Calculated optical flow values to detect motion inconsistencies.
- **Summary Stats**: Overall detection confidence, optical flow statistics, and manipulation detection score.
